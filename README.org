#+title: Character-Specific Image Editing System based on Language Models

** Setup
First follow [[https://github.com/AILab-CVC/YOLO-World#1-installation][the installation guide of YOLO-World]] to set up a Python environment. Then install PyQt5
within this environment by executing the following command:
#+begin_src shell
pip install PyQt5
#+end_src

** Usage
First run the backend server:
#+begin_src shell
python -m src.yolo_world
#+end_src
Then start the GUI by running the following command in a different terminal:
#+begin_src shell
python src/gui/app.py <path_to_server_msg>
#+end_src
where ~<path_to_server_msg>~ is the file by which the front end communicates with the server. This
path can be found in the output log of the previous command, which will be displayed in the
console. On a Linux system, it should default to ~/tmp/yolo-world-server.msg~.

** Demo
We provide a sample in ~assets/demo/~.
